# Each line represents a role's permissions filename to process (e.g., RoleA.json).
# Only the roles specified in this file will be synced or updated.
# Example:
# LL Czech User.json

# If this file is empty, all .json files in the customRole folder will be processed.
# This ensures no specific roles are missed when no selection is made.

# If the word "Skip" is written in this file, the script will log a message
# that the role updating process is skipped and will not execute any updates.
# Example:
# Skip
# Log Message: "Role updating process is skipped as per the txt file."
